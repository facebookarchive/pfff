* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.22 (Q4 2012) (codegraph faster/finer, .cmt/.class parsers)

** codegraph for more languages, at very fine grained level
added OCaml (.ml and .cmt), Java (.java and .class), and improved 
PHP.
Also improved speed a lot.

in addition to PHP, support for java (via .class and .java files),
OCaml (via .cmt files)

** introduce lang_bytecode/ (mostly wrapper around javalib/),
with graph_code support.

** added support for .cmt files for ocaml 4.00 allowing better analysis
of ocaml code, including pfff code

* 0.21 (Q3 2012) (codegraph, java/c parser)

** introduce codegraph, a hierarchical matrix-based dependency visualizer
with support for PHP, C, 

** introduce lang_c/
a simplified version of lang_cpp/ just focusing on C.

* 0.18 (Q4 2011) (codequery)

** introduce codequery, an interactive Prolog-based code query engine,
especially useful to query inheritance information.

** introduce simplified AST for PHP (julien)

** introduce abstract interpreter for PHP (julien)
which leads to a more precise callgraph, type information,
and opens the way for many more checks (including security checks
using tainting analysis).

** scheck: lots of new checks, and removed lots of false positives
while still being reasonably fast, thanks to the use of a lazy entity finder.

** spatch

*** leverage pretty printer so can reindent correctly the code
after some transformation. Thx to julien.
spatch --pretty-printer.

* 0.17 (Q3 2011) (overlay, pm_depend)

** introduce notion of code overlay
with some helper functions to check the validity of an overlay.
Also added some support for overlay in codemap.

Overlays help organize and visualize a (bad) codebase from a different point
of view.

** introduce pm_depend
a package/module dependency visualizer exporting data for Gephi
(only for ocaml code for now). Played with it on the code of pfff
(in package mode) and some of its components: codemap, cpp, php, cmf
(in module mode with and without extern mode).

update: superseded by codegraph

can now display the treemap. Had to report many bugs to the ocsigen team
to get this to work.

** introduce lang_web/ with combined html+js+css parser

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.14 (Q4 2010) (layers, spatch php, more language highlighters)

** codemap

*** layer type, so can save results of global analysis and process them
later in codemap or pfff_statistics

*** layers! like in google earth

- architecture/aspect layer (default one)
- static dead code layer
- dead: dynamic live code layer (using xhprof data)
- test coverage layer (using phpunit and xdebug data)
- 
- bugs layer
- security layer
- cyclomatic complexity, 
- age (and activity) layer
- number of authors layer

*** more semantic visual feedback
can see arguments passed by refs visually (TakeArgNByRef)
as well as functions containing dynamic calls (ContainDynamicCall)

*** visual grep
can now visualize the result of a git grep on a project

*** better visualization of directories
use different color for dirs and files labels, and highlight first
letter of label at depth = 1


** introduce spatch, a syntactical patch
a DSL to express easily refactoring on PHP.

** sgrep/spatch

*** better support for XHP patterns with flexible matching
on attributes

*** experimental support for statement patterns
   can now express patterns like:
    sgrep -e 'foreach($A as $V) { if (strpos($T, $V) !== false) { return Z; }}'

** introducing lang_nw/
so can visualize also Tex/Latex/Noweb source (which includes
the documentation of pfff!)

** introducing lang_lisp/

** introducing lang_haskell/

** introducing lang_python/

** introducing lang_csharp/

** introducing lang_erlang/

** introducing lang_java/

** lang_ml
more highlight

** php analysis

*** finalized the PIL
update: superseded by ast_php_simple.ml

*** dead? dataflow analysis using PIL (thanks to iproctor)
update: supersed by abstract interpreter

** global analysis

*** store additional attributes/properties per entities in the light code db
- does it take argument by refs. 
- does it contain dynamic calls ($fn(...))

This can help the visualizer to give more semantic visual feedback.

** documentation
wrote wiki pages (intro, sgrep, spatch, features, vision, roadmap, etc)

applied codemap on many open source project and generated screenshots.

** internals

*** refactored the code in visual/ to have smaller and cleaner files 
thanks to literate programming and codemap itself to show the problem
and assist in the refactoring

*** refactored code about defs/uses in defs_uses_php.ml
and put more generic stuff in h_program-lang/

*** renamed pfff_visual in codemap

** commons/graph.ml
a polymorphic wrapper around ocamlgraph

(to compute strongly connected components of php callgraph, in prevision
of a bottom up analysis of php)

update: also useful for codegraph backend.

* 0.13

first public release!
https://github.com/facebook/pfff

* 0.12 (Q3 2010) (codemap, light db, tags php, scheck php, ocaml/js parsers)

Real start of multi-language support.

** introduce source code  navigator/searcher/visualizer using cairo

Show treemap and thumbnails of file content!
Have also minimap, zoom, labels, alpha for overlapping labels,
labels in diagonal, anamorphic content showing in bigger fonts
the important stuff, magnifying glass, clickable content 
where a click opens the file in your editor at the right place, etc. 
=> A kind of google maps but on code :)

Support for PHP, Javascript, ML, C++, C, thrift.

For PHP do also URL highlighting which helps understand the control flow
in webapps. 
Also highlight local/globals/parameters variables differently.
Also highlight bad smells (especially security related bad smells)

Integrate other PL artifacts: 
 - The builtins API reference
 - PLEAC cookbooks
=> a single place to query information about the code
(no need to first grep the code, then google for the function
 because it turns out to be a builtin).

Can easily go the definition of a function (whether it's a builtin or not,
thanks to the parsable PHP manual and HPHP idl files).

Can easily go to the example of use of a function (whether it's a builtin
or not, thanks to PLEAC for the builtin functions).

Far more flexible and powerful than the previous treemap visualizer
which was using Graphics. Now also render file content!

** new tool, stags, a TAG generator using ASTs not fragle regexp
support for PHP ocaml

** introduce parsing_ml/
Allow to use and experiment the treemap code visualizer on the pfff
source itself; to see if such features are useful.

** introduce database_code.ml, a generic code-information database
using JSON as support. Will help make pfff less php-specific.

support linear patterns (e.g. sgrep -e 'X & X')
and a -pvar option to print matched metavarables instead of matched code

** internals
reorganized the treemap and h_program-lang/ to be less
facebook and pfff specific. Have a commons/file_type.ml for instance.
