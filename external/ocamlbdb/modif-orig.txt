Taken from lex stein. Just erase unused file, and patch it to make it
work (handle badly handled exception).

update:
 patch it more to be able to handle very big databases (big bug to find).
 Just add set_lg_max_xxx call in Bdb API.

uncomment the #define DEBUG 1  in bdb.src to get more information when
stuff does not work
