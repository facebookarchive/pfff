Install brew http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/
(or install macports http://www.macports.org/)

Then
 $ sudo brew install ocaml

For codemap:
 $ sudo brew install gtk
 $ sudo brew install cairo

For codequery:
 $ sudo brew install swi-prolog

=> you can now run './configure' and build the many pfff tools :) 
See install.txt for the remaining steps.

Troubles?
---------

- If you are using homebrew you may have problems compiling ocamlgtk and 
  ocamlcairo. First You need to 
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig 
  so that configure can find one cairo.pc (the cairo of brew is keg-only),
  but then you want to force to linking with the new cairo library in
  homebrew because the default one of MacOS is causing a segfault.
  So add -L/usr/local/opt/cairo/lib in the generated config.make
  of ocamlcairo for the CAIRO_LIBS variable.

- If you have problem installing cairo and get an error message like:
  "Error: db46 requires the Java for Mac OS X development headers.
  Error: Download the Java Developer Package from: 
  <https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20719>"
  "
  then follows the link and install the Java Developer Package.

  An alternative fix may be to reinstall XCode as indicated at:
  http://yoodey.com/how-fix-db46-problem-macport-installation-or-install-db46-mac-os-x-1065

- If you have problem installing gtk2 and get an error related to atk,
  do: 
    $ sudo port install gobject-introspection 
  and
    $ sudo port install gtk2
  again.

- If you have a problem when compiling pfff in its external/ocamlgtk directory
  with an error like:
  "Error: Error on dynamically loaded library: 
   ./dlllablgtk2.so: dlopen(./dlllablgtk2.so, 138): 
   Symbol not found: _g_simple_async_result_take_error"
 do:
   $ sudo port selfupdate
   $ sudo port upgrade outdated
 which should update glib2 and fix the bug.

- For cairo and gtk don't use the quartz setting as it is currently
  buggy under macports.
